# Build your first API
This project is in progress at the moment. The idea is to build a website where I give the steps to build a basic CRUD API from scratch for multiple languages and explain what is an API and how does it work for people to learn from it.

The current scope for this project includes adding one route that explains what is an API, a route that explains who I am and what is the purpose of this page, a route with a cheatsheet (I would probably want to make it dynamic so users can change between the languages) and one route for each language step by step guide.
